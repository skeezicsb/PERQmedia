This collection of documents has been collected from a number of sources, including the archives at Bitsavers.org, other online archives, and scans of original sources.  It is meant to provide "permanent" links to user manuals and other reference materials related to operating systems and applications that can be run on PERQemu, the PERQ emulator.

In addition, some historical background such as brochures, papers and print ads provide additional context for the PERQ and its place in the computing landscape of the early 1980s.

*Please note: Most of the brochures and ads are 100dpi scans which are suitable for browsing on typical low-DPI displays.  Larger 300dpi scans are available upon request.*
