T2_ServiceGuide.pdf
-------------------

This scan of the ICL publication "PERQ T2 Service Guide" is incomplete.
My copy appears to be a photocopy reduced from A4 to US Letter, likely
a copy of a copy given the state of it.  Moreover, in several chapters
the page numbering was completely off, or pages were simply missing.
Part of my intention in producing this PDF was to sort out and reprint
the manual for my own ease-of-use, as well as preserve it for posterity
and any others who may find it useful.  I would be extremely grateful
to anyone with an original and complete copy if they would make available
the missing pages!

As far as I can tell, the missing pages are:

Chapter 2: pages 3, 14, 16, 18, 20
Chapter 3: page 6
Chapter 6: page i, and all odd-numbered pages 1 through 59

There is still a lot of good information here, however, and I hope others
will find this document useful.
