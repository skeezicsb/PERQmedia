## POS F.15 Amendment 2

This supplemental release for POS F.15 includes software to drive the Canon
laser printers.  This standalone package works with PERQemu v0.5.5 or later
to produce LBP-10 (240dpi) or LBP-CX (300dpi) output in the form of PNG or
TIFF images.  It _should_ also work on the actual hardware, if you happen
to own both a PERQ-1 with old Z80 ROMs _and_ a Canon laser printer with the
"video interface" whose insides haven't turned into goo.

The F.15 hard disk images bundled with _PERQemu_ v0.5.5 have been updated to
include the Canon software.  The floppy images here are in the compressed
".prqm" format.  Amendment 3 is expected to be a full (and likely final)
rebuild with some additional features and a new full media set.
